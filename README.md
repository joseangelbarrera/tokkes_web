# TØKKES: ***Your home a little bit more secure.***

This repo contains my full-stack project Tøkkes built during the Skylab Bootcamp in Barcelona.

Tøkkes are NFC devices that including NFC tags ready to to some task instantly with your phone without unblock it nor introduce any password or code.

Tøkkes is perfect to add a bit more of security in homes worldwide. Tøkkes is easy, cheap and only need to be configured before starting. This app tries to facilitate this part and boots the purchase of these products.

The main idea of this app is to provide an environment where anyone could set up the NFC tags, and order their own customized Tøkkes.
